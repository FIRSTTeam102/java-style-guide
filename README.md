# 1 Introduction

This document will serve as a list of conventions and recommendations for working with WPILib Java and other libraries as a member of Team 102. This guide is heavily based on [WPILib's Java Style Guide](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/styleguide/), with modifications based on our own conventions and practices. This is a guide, not a set of laws. If anything is unclear, use your best judgement and then contact the programming lead with the question. They will decide the correct styling and add it to this guide if necessary.
